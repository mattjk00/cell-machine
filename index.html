                            <p>
                                CellM automata are simulated on a 2D square grid. Each square on the grid represents a single cell is assigned a state value. 
                                The possible states are { 0..n | n >= 2 }. State 0 is reserved as a 'dead' state for the system. This cell generally represents
                                blank space and cannot perform actions on itself.<br/><br/>
                                When designing a system, you should select your states in sequential order. If you want two active states in your system, represent these
                                with states 1 and 2. Unnecessary memory will be allocated if larger state numbers are used when not needed.<br/><br/>
                                Simulation is determined by defined rules. Rules are defined in a similar way to turing machine insuctions.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3 class="uk-text-warning">Rules</h3>
                            <p>
                                Rules tell what action a cell should take depending on its own and neighbors' states. An example of a rule written in English could be: 
                                <i>"If a cell is in state 1 and the right neighbor is in state 2, move left without leaving offspring and change to state 2".</i>
                                That is a convoluted statement but it is an example that contains every piece of information that could be encoded in a rule.<br/><br/>
                                Aa rule definition contains 5 parts:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Current Cell State</li>
                                    <li>Neighbor Selection</li>
                                    <li>Offspring</li>
                                    <li>Movement</li>
                                    <li>Next Cell State</li>
                                </ol>
                                Here is an example of how to define a rule in code:
                                <br/><code>1 0.2 _ l 2</code><br/>
                                Notice the 5 tokens separated by spaces. The first character tells us the current cell state. This means that the following rule
                                will only be applied to cells in this state. In this case, that state is <code>1</code>.
                                The next token <code>0.2</code> gives another rule execution condition to the interpreter. The condition is 'if the right neighbor (0) is 
                                in state 2'. Later on this page the syntax will be explained in depth. The next token <code>_</code> is an underscore, which is meant
                                to represent null or nothing. The third token in the rule tells the interpreter what offspring to leave behind in the current cell's place.
                                In this case, nothing will be left behind if the cell moves due to this rule. The next token <code>l</code> simply states that the cell should
                                move left should the rule's conditions be met. The final token <code>2</code> says what state the cell should become next. If this rule is executed,
                                the grid square to the left of the current cell will change to state 2 and the current cell's square will change to the zero state.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="uk-text-warning">Code File Format</h3>
                            <p>
                                The file structure for your automata simulation is reasonably simple.
                                The first line of every .cal file should declare how many states there are in the system.
                                After declaring how the state count, write out your rules line by line. And that's all you need!
                                Comments can be written using the # symbol. Here is an example of a very simple automata:<br/>
                                <pre class="uk-width-1-2">
<span class="src1">states</span> 2
1 0.0 1 r 1     <span class="src2"># As long as the right neighbor is in state 0,
                # move right and leave behind a cell in state 1.</span></pre><br/>
                                If you placed one cell in state 1 on an empty grid, then that cell would keep moving right indefinitely, leaving a trail.<br/><br/>
                                After declaring all your rules, you may add custom rendering instructions. At the moment, rendering instructions are used just for
                                declaring the size of each cell on the screen (in pixels), as well as the width and height of the grid. This section will be started 
                                with a line of code like this <code>render <i>cell_size grid_width grid_height</i></code> where the parameters in italic will be written
                                as constant numbers. The following lines will state what color each cell should be. The format for these lines will be 
                                <code><i>state 32_bit_hex_color</i></code> Let's extend the simple automata example from above with some rendering rules.<br/>
                                <pre class="uk-width-1-2">
